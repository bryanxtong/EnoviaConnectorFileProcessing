# EnoviaConnectorFileProcessing

Enovia Connector often generates a lot of xml files everyday. and our project is using shell to filter xml files which is less efficient. so use java to 
improve the performance. and also when deleting files, "find" is also inefficient when the number of files in a folder is large.
